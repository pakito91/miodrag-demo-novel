1914 translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea 
of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
I will give you a complete account of the system, and
 expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
  the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.k,k,jhk,kk,k;jl
